# Contributing
[Contact me](https://discord.blob-project.com) if you want to contribute something, look at existing pull requests first before creating a new one.

## Guidelines
I'm open to any bug fixes, or things that make the project looks good and more useful.

As long as you understand TypeScript, or any tools that I used here, you're good to go.
