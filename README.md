# Discord Bot Music
This is my latest own project around Discord bot music.

## Why bother?
The first thing is I couldn't find any functional YouTube search-based music bot.

So, that's the most obvious reason why should I made my own.

## What's so good about it?
I extended this project with more features, such as:
- Supports YouTube, that's obvious.
- Supports playing with .mp3 file.
- Auto-disconnect when no one's in voice channel.

## Can I use this too?
Yeah, sure. I don't mind. You can recreate your own command handler, do your things here.

I'm just hoping that you puts me on credit when you're using this commercial or vice-versa. ;<
